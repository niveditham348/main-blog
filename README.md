# blogWebApp
This lightweight blog application leverages the power of Node.js, Express.js, and EJS to deliver a functional and user-friendly experience without the complexity of a database.

    - Node.js: Acts as the backbone of the application, providing an efficient runtime environment for JavaScript execution.
    - Express.js: A popular web framework, simplifies backend development and manages routes, middleware, and data communication.
    - EJS: A simple yet powerful templating engine, allowing for dynamic generation of HTML content based on JavaScript variables and logic.

## Core Features:

### 1. Post Creation:

    - Users can easily write new blog posts.
    - A user-friendly interface guides through the creation process, from name, title and contents.
    - Created posts are stored in memory during the active session, providing immediate access for editing or viewing.

### 2. Post Viewing:

    - The homepage acts as a central hub, displaying a list of all user-created posts.
    - Each post snippet showcases essential information like title, excerpt, and creation date.

### 3. Post Update/Delete:

    - Each post comes with dedicated buttons for editing and deleting, empowering users to manage their content.
    - Editing opens the post again for modifications, preserving changes upon confirmation.
    - Deleting removes the post entirely from the in-memory storage, streamlining content management.

### 4. Responsive Design and Styling:

    - The application utilizes CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
    - This ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience for users, regardless of whether they access the blog on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
